    "## 1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
    "Ans - Data structures are organized ways of storing and managing data so you can use it efficiently. Think of them as different containers, each designed for a specific kind of job. Some hold items in order, some allow quick searching, and some help you build complex relationships between data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of data structures are as follows:-\n",
    "1. They make programs faster - \n",
    "Choosing the right structure can reduce time spent on searching, inserting, deleting or sorting. For example, searching in a list takes longer than searching in a tree or a hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They help manage large amounts of data - \n",
    "As data grows, simple methods stop working well. Proper structures make sure your program doesn’t slow down or break when the data size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. They make complex problems easier to solve - \n",
    "Graphs, trees and linked lists help break down tasks like networking, file systems, social media connections or recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. They improve memory usage - \n",
    "They help you store data without wasting space. For example, linked lists use space only when needed, unlike fixed-size arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. They are the foundation of algorithms - \n",
    "Almost every algorithm is designed around a data structure. Good understanding of both is important for coding, interviews and real-world software."

    "## 4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
    "Ans - In Python, dictionaries store data as **key–value pairs**, almost like a real-world dictionary where you look up a word (key) to get its meaning (value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data is stored in pairs**\n",
    "Each entry has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a **key** (unique)\n",
    "* a **value** (can be anything)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\"name\": \"Satyam\", \"age\": 20}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Keys are used for fast lookup**\n",
    "Python uses a technique called **hashing**.\n",
    "When you create a key, Python converts it into a number (a hash).\n",
    "This number helps Python jump directly to where the value is stored.\n",
    "So searching is very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Keys must be immutable**\n",
    "You can use strings, numbers or tuples as keys, but not lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Values can be anything**\n",
    "Lists, dictionaries, functions, numbers, anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Order is preserved**\n",
    "Modern Python keeps items in the order you add them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick visual:\n",

    "## 6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
    "Ans- \n",
    "A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Satyam\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks similar to a list because you can index and slice it, but the two are quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. A string stores characters. A list can store anything**\n",
    "A string can only hold letters, digits or symbols as characters.\n",
    "A list can hold integers, strings, floats, objects or even other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Strings are immutable. Lists are mutable**\n",
    "You can’t change a specific character inside a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"hello\"\n",
    "# text[0] = \"H\"   # not allowed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be changed anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "nums[0] = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How they behave in memory**\n",
    "Since strings can’t change, Python creates a new one when you modify it.\n",
    "Lists update in the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Syntax difference**\n",
    "Strings use quotes.\n",
    "Lists use square brackets.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 7.  How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
    "Ans - Tuples help maintain data integrity because once you create them, they cannot be changed. This protects the data from accidental edits in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how they do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. They are immutable**\n",
    "You can’t add, remove or update elements in a tuple.\n",
    "So if something is stored, it stays the same throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. They prevent accidental modification**\n",
    "If you pass a tuple into a function, you don’t have to worry about the function changing its contents by mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. They can be used as reliable keys in dictionaries**\n",
    "Because they never change, Python allows them to be dictionary keys.\n",
    "This gives a stable way to map fixed data to values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. They give predictable behavior**\n",
    "Since nothing inside changes, the same tuple will always represent the same state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. They help document intent**\n",
    "Using a tuple signals that the data is meant to stay fixed, which makes the code clearer."

    "Ans- A hash table is a data structure that stores data using a key and a value, and it lets you find values very quickly. Python dictionaries are built on top of hash tables, so they work the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "example:\n",

    "Advantages are follows :-\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Faster search**\n",
    "Finding something by key in a dictionary is much quicker than searching through a list. Python uses hashing to jump straight to the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. More meaningful access**\n",
    "In a dictionary, you use names or identifiers as keys.\n",
    "In a list, you rely on index numbers, which can be harder to track.\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. No need to remember positions**\n",
    "You don’t have to know where an item is stored.\n",
    "You just use the key to get it.\n",

    "**4. Perfect for structured data**\n",
    "Dictionaries let you store related attributes together.\n",
    "Lists are better when values are ordered, not labeled.\n",

    "**5. Easy updates**\n",
    "Adding or modifying values is simple and doesn’t depend on order.\n",

    "**1. For lists**\n",

    "how it affects data retrieval are follows:\n",
